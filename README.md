dev-tools
=========

This repository is a collection of scripts to help with the development of QRUQSP. It should be added
to the root working directory of the project.

run.php
-------
This script lets you run api calls from the command line. This can be useful for debugging as it lets you 
rerun previous api calls from the UI.

In the dev-tools directory, you need to configure run.ini.  Copy the default run.ini.default to run.ini 
and edit with your development machine information.
